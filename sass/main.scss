/*  4. Components: store BEM blocks that are more self-contained, such as buttons */

/*  5. Layouts: store BEM blocks which contain things that can be reused, such as a form or header for large layouts */

/* 6. Pages: contains blocks of code/rules specific to a single page and won't be reused elsewhere */

/*  7. Themes: store thematic code, such as custom styling for Christmas or Halloween */
