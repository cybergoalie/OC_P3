/* Use the 7:1 pattern of directories for a manageable codebase */

/* The order that you import partials into the main file is the order that Sass will compile all of its contents... as a rule, you want to import in the following order: 1. Utils (variables, functions, mixins, then placeholders), 2. Vendor sheets, 3. Base, 4. Components, 5. Layout, 6. Pages, and 7. Themes */
@import "./utils/variables";
@import "./utils/functions";
@import "./utils/mixins";
@import "./utils/extensions";

@import "./base/base";
@import "./base/typography";

@import "./components/buttons";

@import "./layout/header";
@import "./layout/nav";
@import "./layout/container";
@import "./layout/form";

@import "./pages/rest1.scss";
@import "./pages/rest2";
@import "./pages/rest3";
@import "./pages/rest4";

/* 1. Utils: store variables, functions, mixins, and %placeholders for extensions */

/* 2. Vendors: a directory for third-party library style sheets such as Bootstrap or jquery UI */

/* 3. Base: files that define the foundation of your site, such as the typography and norms you want applied site-wide, like box-sizing */

/*  4. Components: store BEM blocks that are more self-contained, such as buttons */

/*  5. Layouts: store BEM blocks which contain things that can be reused, such as a form or header for large layouts ... container.scss controls the style for all pages */

/* 6. Pages: contains blocks of code/rules specific to a single page and won't be reused elsewhere */

/*  7. Themes: store thematic code, such as custom styling for holidays */

/* The simple structure is convenient for a small project like a single web page:

_base.sass — contains all the resets, variables, mixins, and utility classes
_layout.sass — all the Sass code handling the layout, which is the container and grid systems
_components.sass — everything that is reusable – buttons, navbars, cards, and so on
_main.sass — the main partial should contain only the imports of the already mentioned files
Another example of the same simple structure is the following:

_core.sass — contains variables, resets, mixins, and other similar styles
_layout.sass — there are the styles for the header, footer, the grid system, etc
_components.sass — styles for every component necessary for that project, including buttons, modals, etc.
_app.sass — imports
This is the one I usually use for smaller projects */
