/* can't get this to work yet, but so far.. @mixin linear-gradient($direction, $colors) {
  $list: ();
  @for $i from 1 through length($colors) {
    $list: append($list, nth($colors, $i), comma);
  }
  @if map-has-key($map-for-directions, $direction) {
    background: linear-gradient(
      map-get($map-for-directions, $direction),
      $list
    );
  } @else if not map-has-key($map-for-directions, $direction) {
    @if not index("deg", unit($direction)) {
      @error "#{$direction} is a wrong value for the $direction parameter. The value must be either a number followed by the 'deg' unit or one of the following: #{map-keys($map-for-directions)}.";
    } @else {
      background: linear-gradient($direction, $list);
    }
  }
}

and then add to my element:
.element{
    @include linear-gradient(right, #43c6ac #191654);
    }

    ...however, I kept getting a compilation error that line 6, $map-for-directions is an undefined variable */
